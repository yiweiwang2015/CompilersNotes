\chapter{Runtime organization}
Up to now we have completed the front-end phase of the compiler: lexical analysis, parsing and semantic analysis. These three phases intend to enforce the language definitions. If no errors were generated during the front-end phases, the program proves to be valid in the languages, and we are ready to proceed to the backend phases: optimization and code generation. However, before we can talk about the backend phases, we need to talk about runtime organization.
